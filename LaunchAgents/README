launchd is service management framework for starting, stopping and managing
daemons, applications, processes, and scripts

Daemon runs on behalf of the root.
Agent runs on behalf of the logged user.

To enable autostart for logged user put plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents

To load job manually:
launchctl load ~/job.plist
launchctl unload ~/job.plist

To start loaded job:
launchctl start ~/job.plist

Note: load does not mean start.
Note: load can start automatically when key RunAtLoad exists in plist.
